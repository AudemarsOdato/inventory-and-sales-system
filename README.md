# Medium Sized Sari-Sari Store Inventory and Sales Management System

## Introduction
The Inventory and Sales Management System aims to support growing Sari-sari stores owners who increasingly rely on simple yet efficient technological solutions to manage their daily operations by managing their products, sales, transactions, and stock levels. With the help of modern technology, Inventory and Sales Management System is designed to address these needs by providing a user-friendly platform that helps store owners easily track products, update stocks, and record sales. The system improves accuracy and speeds up data processing that are common when tracking inventories manually.  The system is developed to address common issues experienced by growing Sari-sari store groceries, such as inaccurate stock monitoring, misplaced sales records, and human calculation errors. Efficiently handling inventory levels enhances operational efficiency and financial strategies. Poor management can result in financial losses, delayed order fulfillment, and can lead to both stockouts and overstocking. Also, the time and effort required for manual counting, data entry, and management significantly increase labor costs. By automating these procedures, the system reduces human mistakes and ensures that the inventory is always accurate and up-to-date. At the same time, the system offers essential functions, including recording sales, adding new products, updating product details, and automatically adjusting inventory levels after every transaction. Using this computerized Sales and Inventory system the business owners can ensure that all orders, reports and other documents relating to inventory are uniform in their presentation. This ensures that even first time users can navigate and manage their sales, calculate the entire cost, adding products, restocking, amount purchased, receiving payment and processing sales effectively.  Overall, this inventory and sales management system enhances store operations by combining technology with simplicity. It offers the possibility to improve decision making and business growth while resolving typical problems with manual inventory tracking. By enabling stock tracking updates and user-friendly interfaces, the system delivers convenience, accuracy, and efficiency to growing business operations.     

## Problems
### General Problems
      Mini grocery or sari-sari store owners continue to struggle with managing their daily operations, for the reason that they rely mainly on manual methods of recording sales and monitoring inventory. These traditional practices often lead to challenges such as inaccurate sales entries, miscalculations, difficulty in tracking stock levels, confusion in updating product information, and delays in generating reports or reviewing past transactions. As a result, human errors increase, productivity decreases, and decision-making becomes more difficult, creating a need for a more organized, accurate, and efficient system for handling sales and inventory. 
### Specific Problems
Manually writing down daily sales often leads to different kinds of mistakes, such as miscalculations, missing entries, or inconsistent records which makes it hard for store owners to keep track of their actual earnings and daily transactions.
Inventory checking is done by hand, store owners struggle to keep an accurate count of their stocks. This often results in items running out without their knowledge, buying too much of certain products, or simply losing track of how many items they still have.
Updating product information, like changing prices or recording newly restocked items, becomes time-consuming and confusing when done manually. This can lead to outdated or incorrect details that affect how the store is managed.
Without a proper system, generating sales reports and reviewing past transactions becomes difficult and slow. Store owners have a hard time gathering the information they need, especially when their records are scattered or incomplete.
Human errors that occur during manual sales recording and inventory monitoring often affect the store’s overall workflow, causing financial differences, slower operations, and added stress for the store owners.

### Scopes
Scopes are the system's features and functionalities that highlights what the system can do. The system’s functionalities includes Inventory management and POS and Sales management .The Inventory Management covers the monitoring of stock levels, updating item details, and maintaining accurate product records.

### Limitations
Like any system created within a specific time frame and set of requirements, this project has certain boundaries that affect what it can fully provide. Although the system is designed to help a growing sari-sari store manage its products and sales more easily, there are still features and functions that fall outside its current design. These limitations outline what the system can realistically handle based on its scope, resources, and intended use.

Single Store Operation Only - The system is limited to one sari sari store setup and does not support multi branch or multi location management.
Local and Offline Use Only -	The system operates strictly on site and cannot be accessed online or through external devices. No cloud based features or remote monitoring are included.
Manual Product Encoding - All product details, prices, and stock updates must be manually entered by the user. Errors in data entry may affect inventory accuracy since there is no  automated item recognition.
